Apache Tomcat:
In the Java world, they decided to create small pieces of code to serve application requests, without having to worry about how HTTP requests/responses work.

They called these pieces Servlets.

What Tomcat does is: It recieves a HTTP request over a TCP connection. It parses it into a Request object, and calls your Servlet. Your Servlet generates all the output in a Response object. Tomcat sends this back as a HTTP response over that TCP connection.

This is exactly what Tomcat does.

Note: This is what a Servlet container in general does. We unfortunately do not see a FTPServlet, SSHServlet or a SMTPServlet in action today - but originally, this is exactly the sort of thing a Servlet was supposed to solve - don't worry too much about the protocol, worry about the application logic.

Getting started:
JVM
A Java virtual machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance. The specification is a document that formally describes what is required of a JVM implementation.
